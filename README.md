# 3D-Chess-Rendering
 This program creates a 3D chess set model using OpenGL and GLUT.
 Each chess piece is modeled using 6 distinct GLUT shapes.

Renders a chess set and provides lighting settings: 
key 0 enables/disables ambient lighting
key 1 enables/disables diffused lighting
Also provides rotation of the chess set using key r/R, rotating counterclockwise by 10 degrees about z axis
and eye movement of the chess set by pressing u/U to move eye up and d/D to move eye down.
